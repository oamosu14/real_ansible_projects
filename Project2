**Ansible Project 2**

Additional Information and Resources
Your CTO has greenlit a proof of concept for Ansible in your environment. You are to set up an Ansible control node in a test environment and verify basic functionality. You have three demo hosts, one to be the control node (control1), and two to serve as managed nodes (node1 and node2). You must complete the following steps:

1. Install Ansible on the control node.
2. Configure the ansible user on the control node for ssh shared key access to managed nodes.
Note: do not use a passphrase for the key pair.
3. Create a simple Ansible inventory on the control node in /home/ansible/inventory containing node1 and node2.
4. Configure sudo access for Ansible on node1 and node2 so that Ansible may use sudo for any command with no password prompt.
5. Verify each managed node can be accessed by Ansible from the control node using the ping module. Redirect the output of a successful command to /home/ansible/output.

Important Notes:

The user ansible is already present on all servers for your convenience.
The ansible user has the same password as the cloud_user.
/etc/hosts entries are present on control1 for the managed nodes.
